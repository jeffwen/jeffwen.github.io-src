Summary: Setting up the blog and things to remember

_November 28, 2015_

Over the past couple of days, I have been working towards getting a blog up and running. There were a couple of different options that I was considering and ultimately I ended up choosing to use [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) as my site generator. I also use GitHub Pages to host my blog for free!

### Decisions 
Initially, I was considering just sticking with Jekyll, which is the site generator that pairs really nicely with the [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). However, I read a couple different posts by other users, thought about the decision, and noticed the following:

1. _Ruby vs. Python_: Jekyll is Ruby based whereas Pelican is Python based.
    * While I am also picking up Ruby, I am definitely more comfortable with Python at this point.

2. _Speed_: While I am still new to blogging and don't necessarily feel the struggle of slow page loading (given that I don't have much experience with slow loading blogs), [this user's](http://arunrocks.com/moving-blogs-to-pelican/) blog post was definitely persuasive enough for me to take speed into consideration.

3. _Personal Growth_: Jekyll might have been easier to use given that it is integrated with GitHub so well, but I wanted to (at least in my mind at the time) learn a little bit more by using something that required just a little more work. 

### Getting Started
With these things in mind, I decided to jump right in and start setting up my blog. While it was quite simple for the most part, it definitely took some time figuring everything out because I was trying to use a couple different resources to make sure that by blog would run smoothly. Looking back on it, I guess it probably would have been better to stick with one solid resource vs. trying to merge different ways of doing the same thing. However, as stated before, I wanted to learn as much as possible and see the different ways people were setting up their blogs.

- Resources:
    - [Pelican Documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/)
    - [Amy Halon's blog post on GitHub Pages Migration](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html)
    - [Fedora Magazine's blog post on GitHub Pages and Pelican](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/)

As I was following some of the resources mentioned earlier, I realized that It was a great opportunity for me to also learn more about other technologies as well. For example, I read up on GitHub submodules because Fedora's post mentioned initiaizing the output directory as a submodule. I am getting my hands dirty with Markdown because I am using Markdown to write these blog posts and pages. Additionally, HTML and CSS are relevant as well because I am learning to customize my blog.

### Final Thoughts
It may seem that this blog post is rather short and ending prematurely, but I have only started to blog and so I hope that as I learn more about Pelican and blogging I will share more of my learnings and thoughts!
