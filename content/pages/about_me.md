Slug: about-me

Hi, I am Jeff.

I am interested in many things and enjoy the outdoors (see some of my [photos](/pages/photography.html))!

I try to learn as much as I can across diverse topics such as [machine learning for remote sensing](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/790), [neuroscience](http://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1259), [environmental sustainability](http://repository.upenn.edu/mes_capstones/62/), and [business philosophy](https://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=2388). I also enjoy tearing things down and attempting to put it back together so that I can learn more about how things work.

For all the professional things feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenjeff) or [resume](/html/jeff_resume_2017.html).

Anyways, if you would like to get in touch please email me at jeff DOT li DOT wen AT gmail DOT com.
