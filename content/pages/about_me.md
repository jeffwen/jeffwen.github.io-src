Slug: about-me

Hi, I am Jeff.

I am interested in many things and enjoy the outdoors!

When I get the chance, I try to read as much as I can about topics ranging from neuroscience to the environment to [business philosophy](https://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=2388). When I was younger (much younger), I also liked tearing things down to see what was happening then trying to put it all back together (not as much now because I can't get away with broken computers, gadgets, and toys...).

For all the professional things feel free to check out by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenjeff).

Anyways, if you would like to get in touch you can email me at **jeff DOT li DOT wen AT gmail DOT com**
